# Cyber Security Internship – Task 10

## 📌 Task Title
Firewall Configuration & Testing

## 🛠 Tools Used
- UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
- Nmap (for testing)

## 🎯 Objective
To understand firewall concepts and gain hands-on experience in configuring, testing, and analyzing firewall rules to secure a system against unauthorized network access.

## 📚 Task Overview
This task focuses on configuring a host-based firewall using UFW on a Linux system.  
Firewall rules were created to allow necessary services, block unused ports, test connectivity, monitor logs, and analyze the impact of firewall policies on system security.

All activities were performed in a controlled lab environment for educational purposes.

## 🧪 Configuration Environment
- Operating System: Linux (Kali / Ubuntu)
- Firewall Tool: UFW
- Testing Tool: Nmap
- Network Type: Local / Lab Network

## 🔍 Key Learnings
- Understanding firewall fundamentals
- Configuring inbound and outbound firewall rules
- Allowing and denying ports using UFW
- Testing firewall rules using Nmap
- Monitoring and analyzing firewall logs
- Importance of firewalls in network security

## 🛡 Security Impact
Proper firewall configuration significantly reduces the attack surface by limiting unauthorized network access.  
While firewalls cannot prevent all attacks, they are a critical component of a layered security strategy.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
All firewall configurations and tests were performed on a local lab system owned by the user. No production or unauthorized systems were affected.
